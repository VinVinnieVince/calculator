My attempt at The Odin Project's calculator assignment, found here https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator

07/08/2024 - Calculator buttons can now be activated with the respective keyboard keys, in addition to the following:
* 'Esc' is wired to 'AC'
* 'Enter' alongside the original '=' button, is wired to '='
Please give it a try! 

Known possible bugs(?):
* Number -> Operator -> Equals adds the currently displayed number with most recent number -this is fixable but is also correct? Unsure to keep or not

Please let me know if there are any other bugs!
