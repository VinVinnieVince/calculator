# calculator
My attempt at The Odin Project's calculator assignment, found here https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator

Known possible bugs(?):
* Number -> Operator -> Equals adds the currently displayed number with most recent number -this is fixable but is also correct? Unsure to keep or not

Please let me know if there are any other bugs!
